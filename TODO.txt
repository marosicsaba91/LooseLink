Service is not marked by Interface
	Instead:
		1. [Service(instantiateAutomatically = false)] Attribute
		2. Virtual method on intaller for suitable Types
	[Ignore] Attribute not needed anymore.
	Add IInitializableService interface
		void InitBeforeFirstLocated();
	Use Icons for individual objects. (Transform, Rigidbody...)
	Should be used with custom types!
